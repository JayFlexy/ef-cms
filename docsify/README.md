# The Dawson Documentation

The goal for this documentation is to consolidate all of the various forms of documentation we have for this project into a single easy to navigate website.

## How to Contribute?

The documentation is built using the open source tool [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).

You can learn how to customize the theme for these docs [here](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/customization?id=sidebar)

To contribute to this documentation, you can run `npm run docs` which will preview the documentation at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and live reload as you change the .md files.  Change the `docsify/*.md` files as needed.

## Where to Start?

If you are brand new to this project, we recommend trying to read through this readme in sequential order.  Each part of the documentation attempts to build upon the last to ease the learning experience.  There is a lot to this system, so the goal is to learn a little bit at a time.

If you're ready for the challenge, naviage to the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) and start learning about Dawson.

Otherwise, if you're just interested in a particular topic, you can find it in the sidebar.
