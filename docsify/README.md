# Electronic Filing / Case Management System (DAWSON)

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Dawson Documentation! ðŸŽ‰

The goal for this documentation is to consolidate all of the various forms of documentation we have for this project into a single easy to navigate website built using the open source tool [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/).


You can learn how to customize the theme for these docs [here](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/customization?id=sidebar)

## Where to Start?

If you are brand new to this project, we recommend trying to read through this readme in sequential order.  Each part of the documentation attempts to build upon the last to ease the learning experience.  There is a lot to this system, so the goal is to learn a little bit at a time.

If you're ready for the challenge, naviage to the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) and start learning about Dawson.
