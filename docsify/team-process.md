# Team Process

Now that you've logged in and played around with our Dawson system a big on a deployed environment, let's talk about our team process and what is expected from our fellow teammates.  This part of the documentation should help members get on the same page when it comes to the soft-skills required to work as a well oiled agile machine.

## 🤝🏿 Working Agreement

We have talked about writing some form of working agreement so team members have a common understanding of what is expected from them during their daily work.  Great teams strive for open communication, safe spaces to speak their mind, and continous improvement in process.  Embracing some of the following ideologies will help grow and sustain a healthy team.

### Flexion Fundamentals

For Flexioneers, remember to read and apply the flexion fundamentals to your daily work.  Doing so will help you write higher quality software, and it should help you grow as a person in general.

### Pair / Mob Programming

A majority of stories and bug we work on should be tackled using pair or mob programming.  The reason we utilize this type of programming is because it produces higher quality software, helps developer find defects in a shorter feedback loop, increases creativity, and strengthens knowledge sharing.  Remember, **cooperation** and **communication** are keys to *success*. 

> Two minds are better than one.

### Quality over Speed

It has been made clear many times from the Court that producing high quality software (low defects, easy to manage and understand) is far more important than quickly delivering features.  All code should be covered with all forms of testing (unit, integration, smoke testing), we should be spending 20% of our sprints refactoring code, documentation has been written, and stories should not be considered done until meeting our Definition of Done criteria.

## Agile Meetings

We strive to be keep our project as Agile as possible.  This means that every sprint we follow the typical scrum ceremonies to allow our team to plan for the upcoming work without planning too far ahead.  If you are already an expert in Agile, you may want to skim over this section, but since every team encorporates Agile processses their own way it might be worth a read through.

### Daily Standup

Since we strive to work in pairs and mobs, our stand ups focus more on group goals.  Every morning we meet to talk about our goals for our current sprint and also talk about our story goals for the day.  We also setup **parking lot** items to give an opportunity to discuss anything important topics that the entire team should.  We will also give small demos of story / bug progress to the tax court.

### Environment Shuffle

Every week our team rotates a schedule for who is responsible for the environment shuffle.  This process is to merge changes in from the court into our Flexion fork, and also create batch PRs if the batch is ready.  Please view the [Environment Shuffle](pr-workflow?id=environment-shuffle) part of the documentation for more information.
